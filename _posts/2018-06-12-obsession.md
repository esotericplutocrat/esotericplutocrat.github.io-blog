Obsession: A Quenchless Torment

Our mind is always clouded by ambition and goals. In this pursuit of ambition, you’ll be focused and diligent. But, in your heart you won’t really enjoy life as it will always be in a pursuit. There’s no sensuality and poetry involved. This pursuit is devoid of any meaning and is destructive at it’s core. Don’t fall into the trap of bondage. It’s full of misery. Enjoy it but don’t get indulged. Attachment is the root cause of misery. Existence is so tremendously vast and infinite. If you want to focus on one thing like a laser, sure maybe you’ll be a genius at it. But you will miss out on this life. It does come at a cost and a very big one. 

“Obsession is endless…” 

You’ll never be satisfied. It’s a one way trip and there’s no coming back. Alexander, Stalin, Hitler, Genghis Khan… they all were great misers. They suffered from a great inferiority complex. When you feel inferior, you boast, cast a greater shadow of yourself because you want to feel superior. This is why people want to dominate and this hunger never ends. It is unhealthy and unsustainable. Even though obsession is endless, your life is finite. But, it will never end well! Even Alexander died a poor man… a miser. Richness is not about money or power. You can be a beggar and live like a king or you can be a king and live like a beggar. If you cling and won’t let it go, being afraid and possessive, you’ll always remain a beggar at your core. If you hold your breath and not let it go… will it make you rich? You’ll just choke to death. 

If you decide to pursue our obsession then just know the outcome:

“Either you end up in grave or in jail”

It may not be an actual jail but a solitary confinement within yourself where you’ll be devoid of life. Many people die when they are 40 and are buried when they are 80. These people went down the path of obsessiveness. 

Jordan Belfort aka “The Wolf of Wall-Street” partied like a rockstar and lived like a king. At the epitome of his exuberant lifestyle, he binged on cocaine, ludes and all the other crazy drugs, dated the most popular models of his time, made $50 Million annually in his prime. In short, he had that crazy lifestyle which people only dream about. But, where is he now? Is he still sustaining that crazy lifestyle? No, he spent 18 months in prison and later became a successful author and keynote speaker. If it wasn’t for prison I would have died due to that crazy lifestyle, he says.  

According to him, the key to life is balance. “ If you live an exuberant life like me, that’s unhealthy and unsustainable. The key is balance, the key is moderation in everything you do. Eventually everything spirals out of control ”

He explains this eccentric concept of balance with a beautiful and profound anecdote:

“ Wolves had once roamed free there in the western United States, ruled their ecosystem but then they’ve been made extinct by hunters. So an experiment was performed to reintroduce 14 wolves into this area. And the area was sort of like devastated. There wasn’t a lot of vegetation, not many flowers, wasn’t a lot of water around and when they reintroduced these 14 wolves to put them back in the area… It’s so mind boggling! 20 years later this whole place was blossoming and there’s water and rivers and everything. Because, what happened was, apparently when they were killing the wolves, it threw the whole ecosystem out of balance. That is really an interesting metaphor because you look at it like is there really absolute good or absolute bad? People killed the wolves to save the sheep from being eaten by wolves, yet in the end, by killing the wolves they destroyed the whole ecosystem. It’s about balance! When people look at my lifestyle, they say it’s glamorous and it’s fun. But, there’s something called balance in there without which the character never ends well. ”

People have this preconceived notion that life is reaching this goal or fulfilling this desire. Somewhere amidst in this singularity of focus they encounter a midlife crisis which is an exit through this hell. But, some still choose to carry on with their misery and they don’t realise:

“Happiness is not reaching the other side of the river… It is the journey throughout the river.”
