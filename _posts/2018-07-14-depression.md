Life can be meaningful enough to justify it’s suffering. 

I agree life is not just about happiness. There are times in our lives where we are at the abyss of sorrow, completely devastated. You have to *Keep going.* Life is about how much you can take in and keep moving forward. But, if you’re really happy then you’re bloody fortunate. Enjoy, while it lasts because you never know about what happens next. You have to live. Life is so full of opportunities and quitting is not the only way. 

There are two ways to live life. The first one is :
>“Life is meaningless and whatever you do doesn’t matter. ”  

If you follow this approach then sure you’ll always be depressed and dissatisfied with life. But the upside to this philosophy is that “You don’t have to take any responsibility about anything.” It’s an easy way out. Hence most people follow this approach of mediocrity.

Another way to live life is :
> “Whatever you do matters. Your each action has certain consequences.”  

If you follow this approach then you have to take full responsibility for your actions. With your each you tilt the world a little bit to the good or bad. You conjure your own world. You don’t gets away with anything so take responsibility for your own life.

If you’re depressed. Do something that makes you happy. Your favourite movie, show, game, music. Eat something sweet, ice-cream. Go out for a walk or somewhere in the laps of nature. Because when you feel low and depressed you cannot think clearly. Your mind is clouded by intense negative emotions which affect your decision-making. 

Jordan Peterson, a renowned psychologist suggests that the following elements form the pillars of life:

1. Do you have a circle of friends, including at least one or two people that you can really talk to?
2. Do you have a close, intimate, romantic relationship?
3. Do you have a meaningful job, or educational path, or serious personal interest (or some combination thereof)?
4. Have you avoided problems with drugs or alcohol?
5. Do you have a realistic, meaningful plan for the future?
6. Are you in good physical health?
7. Do you have at least a necessary minimum of economic resources?

If the answer to all or even most of these questions is "no," then you will have an extremely tough time as those are elements necessary for a standard human life.

If you are baffled or overwhelmed and don’t have control over your life, structure your life. Have a schedule. What happens is people don’t have a schedule and they don’t sleep and wake up at a regular time. This disturbs your cardiac rhythms which triggers you to feel depressed. And if your morning starts with feeling low then there’s a chain reaction of bad events which makes you feel more and more gloomy with each moment. 

Instant gratification due to technology and social media make us feel anxious and depressed all the time. The grass is always greener in the neighbour’s yard. What we see on social media is not reel life rather than real life. Don’t compare yourself with other people, compare yourself with who you were yesterday. 

You cannot feel happiness without sadness. *After a great cry comes a great laughter.* It is completely alright to feel low. Suffering paves the way for awakening. There are times when you feel tasteless, you cannot feel sad or happy. This state of emotional tastelessness is the actual depression. In the abyss of sadness, many times we discover invaluable revelations about ourselves and our lives. 

There are times when you feel tasteless, you cannot feel sad or happy. This state of emotional tastelessness is the actual depression. That is unhealthy, allow yourself to feel the full burst of emotions whether happy or bad. There’s nothing wrong with crying, rather it makes you feel more relieved. 
Things cannot make make you truly happy. You can indulge in hedonistic happiness but it is always shallow and superficial. You won’t feel the intense and deep emotions. 

Last year I interviewed Prof. Moshe Vardi, who won an equivalent of a Noble Prize in Computer Engineering. During which I asked him about how he felt when he won that noble prize. His reply was extremely mature and full of insights which will disrupt your preconceived notions about happiness:

>“It was like chocolate… You feel delighted and blissful when you eat it but the next day you feel nothing. After a while, that feeling of euphoria dissipates into nothing. You should enjoy the process more than the outcome.”
