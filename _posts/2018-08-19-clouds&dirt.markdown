Clouds & Dirt

Only when you love the dirt you can reach the clouds. You should love the process more than the outcome. He problem is people are always interested in superficial things like fame, money and prestige. If you do it for the money, you won’t make it. You won’t be able to endure and eventually you’ll quit. But when you love the process the motivation, the urge is intrinsic. Things like money & fame come to you… you don’t have to chase them. Even if you don’t get the fame or wealth, you won’t care because you love what you do. Whatever you’re doing makes you happy. That’s how it should be.

This is the subtle difference between successful & unsuccessful people. For example, most of them want to be an actor because of he wealth, fame and the luxurious lifestyle that comes with it. They don’t have the right motivation and purpose to do it. But the elites who are the masters of these domains reached the zenith because they love the process. They will do it even if it is not cool. Biggie Smalls did hiphop & rap before it was popular. Gary Vee was an entrepreneur way before it was cool. These infamous folks will do their stuff even if it’s not cool anymore. 

Tibetan monks create a piece of an intricate sand art known as “The Sand Mandala” Unique to Tibetan Buddhism, monks first create a drawing from memory and then begin to fill it in with colourful sand. But this is no ordinary sand art, the grains of sand are carefully placed along the drawing with funnels, tubes, and scrapers over a course of few days or even months. As the monks do this, they recite sacred chants to the divine spirits to meditative music.

 Once it's completed, the mandala is blessed and the sand is swept away and disposed of in water in what's called a "Dissolution Ceremony." Yup, all that work of months is just destroyed like a sand castle at the beach.

This anecdote signifies the Buddhist belief in the impermanence of life. You should never be concerned about the outcome.
